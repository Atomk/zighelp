## Why fork of ziglearn?

I wanted to add light and dark mode, and a few other things.

I also wanted to be able to add content without having to wait for a PR to be merged.

Also there is a lot of good content in the ziglearn repo that hasn't been merged yet.

I have also added tests to CI/CD to make sure the code examples work.
